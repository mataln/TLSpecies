Implementation for TLS species ID paper - placeholder.

A note before this readme begins - the code for this paper was written when the original publication, 
*Revisiting Point Cloud Shape Classification with a Simple and Effective Baseline* (Goyal et al., 2021), was under review and code from the original authors 
was not available. Now that it has been published, you can find it [here](https://github.com/princeton-vl/SimpleView). You might find that it is better 
optimised, or in some way more flexible/easier to use. Otherwise, details for this repository can be found below. <br/>
